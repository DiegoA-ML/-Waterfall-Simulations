# Waterfall-Simulations
After a grueling first block, me and my classmates enjoyed La Estanzuela, a natural park, where we were captivated by the majestic waterfalls. Inspired by our surroundings and a recent class on Stochastic Optimization, we joked about using Monte Carlo methods to simulate the beauty we saw in nature.

Influenced by this, I developed two Python simulations of a waterfall using Monte Carlo randomness to recreate the natural, fluid flow of water. The simulations mimic how particles move unpredictably yet gracefully, much like a real cascade.

The simulations are built with Pygame and they visualize the motion of particles that represent water droplets, behaving in a stochastic, fluid-like manner.

## Key Features:

 • Monte Carlo Randomization: The codes use Monte Carlo techniques to introduce natural randomness into the movement of each particle, creating a realistic simulation of cascading water.
 
 • Particle Physics: Each particle follows a path determined by gravity and random velocity components, simulating the erratic yet graceful motion of water as it flows downward.
 
 • Dynamic Interaction: Particles bounce off platforms and are reset when they move off-screen, creating a continuous flow that mirrors a real-life waterfall.

 • Customizable Parameters: Gravity, velocity, and bounce factors can be tweaked to adjust the flow dynamics and particle behavior.
